# HeartDiseaseCalc
Sample application with R to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Heart Failure Dataset. Because I study in Poland, some texts in app had to be in polish. 

## Data
Data comes from Kaggle "Heart Failure Prediction"

## Steps done
<li> Data Cleaning
<li> Perform EDA
<li> Make simple Random Forest model to predict Heart Failure
<li> Create simple shiny app to show the results
<li> Also I used DALEX library for model explanation

## Results
The results can be seen here: <a>https://rafalnojek.shinyapps.io/heartfailureapp/</a>
